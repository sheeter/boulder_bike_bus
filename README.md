# Boulder Bike Bus

Join kids and families biking to school (and having fun!) on Kid Safe streets. You can hop on and off the bus anywhere along the route — no need to meet us at the start or ride with us to the end. Background about the bike bus movement [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-02-10/kids-board-bike-trains-from-barcelona-to-san-francisco).

## The Boulder Bike Bus is launching on Fridays in fall 2022. 

### TBD Friday Date: North Boulder to Boulder Creek

When: TBD - meet at 7:30 AM, roll at 7:45 AM

Who: Anyone who wants to ride, roll, scoot, or skate to school! Parents, teachers, kiddos, and fellow bikers/skaters/rollers are welcome.
